# Plant-Ai---IT254
My repository for IT 254 group project.

Hardware needed
-Arduino
-Soil Moisture Sensor
-DHT11 for temp
-Wires
-Breadboard
-Resistor (10k preferably)
-LCD
-USB Cable
-Power supply (laptops should suffice)
-Plant with soil

Software Used
-Arduino IDE
-DHT Sensor Library
-LiquidCrystal Library (for LCD)
-Python for code

This project will be using the Arduino to measure soil temperature and moisture in soil to give us the perfect enviroment for the plant. To measure the soil temp a DHT11 sensor will be used and inserted into the soil. For the moisture level a Soil Moisture Sensor will be used. The main goal for this project is to give the plant a perfect enviroment to flourish in giving the best moisture and temp for the soil.
