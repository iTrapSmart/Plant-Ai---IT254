# Plant-Ai---IT254
My repository for IT 254 group project.

Hardware needed
-Arduino
-DHT11 sensor
-16 Male to Male Wires and 3 Male To Female Wires
-Breadboard
-Resistor (10k preferably)
-LCD (lc2)
-USB Cable
-Power supply (laptops should suffice)
-Plant with soil
-Contrastor (10k)

Software Used
-Arduino IDE
-DHT Sensor Library
-LiquidCrystal Library (for LCD)
-Python for code

This project will be using the Arduino to measure soil temperature and moisture in soil to give us the perfect enviroment for the plant. To measure the soil temp a DHT11 sensor will be used and inserted into the soil. This project will also use a local AI to take the type of flower and moisture level to give ideas on how to improve the enivroment to make the flower flourish. The main goal for this project is to give the plant a perfect enviroment to flourish in giving the best moisture and temp for the soil.

This youtube link is my video demonstration on how to make and use the soil moisture arudino build

All is made by me and my group with the help of googling code and testing diagrams using wokwi to test the arduinos virtually.
